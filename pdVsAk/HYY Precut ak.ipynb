    "### What is the Higgs boson?\n",
    "The Higgs boson is a fundamental particle predicted by the Standard Model. It is a manifestation of the Higgs field, which gives mass to fundamental particles. However, it is incredibly difficult to produce. At the LHC, a Higgs particle is produced about once every 10 billion collisions, making it very challenging to detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this tiny fraction, years of data collection led to the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 by the CMS and ATLAS experiments at CERN. In this tutorial, we will follow their example."

    "This analysis loosely follows the [discovery of the Higgs boson by ATLAS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026931200857X) (Section 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Higgs boson can be generated through various mechanisms. In particle physics, we use Feynman diagrams to illustrate these production modes. These diagrams help us visualize particle interactions and serve as essential tools for computations. For additional details on Feynman diagrams, see this [link](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2759490/files/Feynman%20Diagrams%20-%20ATLAS%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf).\n",

    "\n",
    "The Higgs boson has an extremely brief lifetime, approximately $10^{-22} \\,\\text{s}$. It decays almost immediately after it is produced, making direct detection of the particle impossible. However, by using the Standard Model, we can predict the various decay products of the Higgs, such as photons, Z bosons, quarks, and others, each occurring with different probabilities. These **decay channels** help us identify the presence of the Higgs boson. In this notebook, we will focus on analyzing one specific decay channel:\n",
    "$$H \\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<CENTER><img src=\"images/feynman_diagrams/Hyy_feynman.png\" style=\"width:40%\"></CENTER>\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to this as our desired **signal**. Ideally, we aim to identify collisions that produce two photons, which would indicate the presence of a Higgs boson. However, along with our signal, many photons detected do not originate from Higgs boson decay but rather from other processes, forming the **background**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backgrounds are classified into two categories: reducible and irreducible. **Reducible backgrounds** can be significantly minimized using experimental techniques such as data cuts, particle identification, and isolation criteria. For instance, in our case, a reducible background might involve events where a jet is misidentified as a photon. By applying stricter criteria to ensure that the detected particles are indeed photons (and not misidentified jets), this background can be reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, irreducible backgrounds cannot be easily distinguished from the signal because they involve the same final states or processes that the signal would produce. In the scenario of Higgs decay into two photons, an **irreducible background** would be the direct production of two photons from other Standard Model processes, such as quark-antiquark annihilation. These events are fundamentally indistinguishable from the signal events based on final state particles alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "To address this, we can consider the total invariant mass of the photon products. By conservation of energy and momentum, the invariant mass of the products must equal the Higgs mass, whereas other background processes will have different invariant masses. The final step is to plot the invariant mass of each event and identify the peak around 125 GeV, which corresponds to the mass of the Higgs boson.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Learn to process large data sets using cuts\n",
    "2. Understand some general principles of a particle physics analysis\n",
    "3. Discover the Higgs boson!\n",

By setting these constraints, we can reduce the impact of background processes and thereby improve the signal-to-background ratio. Given that photons are massless particles, enforcing these requirements on transverse energy is effectively equivalent to enforcing them on transverse momentum.\n",

    "We are now ready to fit our data to effectively detect the Higgs boson! We will use a combination of a 4th order polynomial and a Gaussian function. The polynomial function represents the background, while the Gaussian function represents our signal. The Gaussian model is used to fit the signal due to the nature of the detector's resolution. The fourth-order polynomial is chosen for the background because it offers enough flexibility to capture the overall shape without overfitting, thereby reducing the influence of spurious data—random, irrelevant fluctuations or noise that do not correspond to the true signal or background."
